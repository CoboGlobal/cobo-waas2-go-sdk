  /transactions/{transaction_id}/drop:
    post:
      description: |
        This operation drops a specified transaction. Dropping a transaction leverages RBF to replace the original transaction with a version that effectively cancels it. For more details about dropping a transaction, refer to [Drop a transaction](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/transactions/manage-transactions#drop-a-transaction).

        A transaction can be sped up only if its status is `Broadcasting`.

        <Note>This operation only applies to transactions from Custodial Wallets (Web3 Wallets), MPC Wallets and Smart Contract Wallets. It does not apply to transactions on the following chains: VET, TRON, TVET, SOL, and TON.</Note>

        You can use the `address` or `included_utxos` properties in the request body to specify the address or UTXOs that will cover the transaction fee. Generally, the transaction fee is paid by the original transaction's source. If that source's balance is insufficient, the specified address or UTXOs can be used to cover the fee.

        This operation accelerates a specified transaction. Speeding up a transaction will trigger a Replace-By-Fee (RBF) transaction which is a new version of the original transaction. For more details about speeding up a transaction, refer to [Speed up a transaction](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/transactions/manage-transactions#speed-up-a-transaction).

        You can use the `address` or `included_utxos` properties in the request body to specify the address or UTXOs that will cover the transaction fee.

        This operation creates a request to unfreeze funds for a previously frozen transaction. It releases the frozen funds back to their original state.

        <Note>The unfreeze process will release the compliance hold on the transaction, allowing it to proceed normally.</Note>

Refer to [Transaction sources and destinations](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/transactions/sources-and-destinations) for a detailed introduction about the supported sources and destinations for each transaction type.

        **You need to specify either the `account_output` property or the `utxo_outputs` property.**

        You can transfer tokens to multiple addresses only if you use MPC Wallets as the transaction source. To do this, you should use the `utxo_outputs` property to specify the destination addresses.

        The type of permission for token operations. Each permission grants specific capabilities:

        - `ManagePermissions`: Ability to grant and revoke permissions to addresses.

        - `ManageAccessAndControls`: Ability to manage access control mechanisms including allowlist and blocklist operations.

        - `MintTokens`: Ability to mint tokens and increase the total supply.

        - `BurnTokens`: Ability to burn tokens and decrease the total supply.

        - `RecoverTokens`: Ability to recover tokens from specified addresses.

        - `UpgradeContract`: Ability to upgrade the smart contract implementation.

        - `PauseContract`: Ability to pause and unpause the contract.

        - `FreezeAccounts`: Ability to freeze and unfreeze addresses.

        - `UpdateMetadata`: Ability to update token metadata.

        - `WrapTokens`: Ability to wrap and unwrap tokens for wrapped token implementations.

          description: |
            The number of seconds until the pay-in order expires, counted from when the request is sent. For example, if set to `1800`, the order will expire in 30 minutes. Must be greater than zero and cannot exceed 3 hours (10800 seconds). After expiration:

            - The order status becomes final and cannot be changed
            - The `received_token_amount` field will no longer be updated
            - Funds received after expiration will be categorized as late payments and can only be settled from the developer balance.
            - A late payment will trigger a `transactionLate` webhook event.
