## Methods

### NewBridgingFee

`func NewBridgingFee(feeAmount string, ) *BridgingFee`

NewBridgingFee instantiates a new BridgingFee object

and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewBridgingFeeWithDefaults

NewBridgingFeeWithDefaults instantiates a new BridgingFee object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

`func (o *BridgingFee) GetReceivedTokenIdOk() (*string, bool)`

GetReceivedTokenIdOk returns a tuple with the ReceivedTokenId field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetReceivedTokenId

`func (o *BridgingFee) SetReceivedTokenId(v string)`

SetReceivedTokenId sets ReceivedTokenId field to given value.

### HasReceivedTokenId

`func (o *BridgingFee) HasReceivedTokenId() bool`

HasReceivedTokenId returns a boolean if a field has been set.

### GetReceivedAmount

`func (o *BridgingFee) GetReceivedAmount() string`

GetReceivedAmount returns the ReceivedAmount field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetReceivedAmountOk

`func (o *BridgingFee) GetReceivedAmountOk() (*string, bool)`
